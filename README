SBLIM CMPI Development Package
==============================

The purpose of this package is to provide a standalone development kit
for CMPI providers. It contains the CMPI header files needed for compilation
of CMPI providers written in the C programming language.

It also contains the so-called CMPI C++ Wrapper, consisting of C++ header
files and a shared library implementing the C++ support.

You can find the CMPI documentation on the following website
http://www.opengroup.org/bookstore/catalog/c051.htm

Depending on the way you configure the package, the header files go to
/usr/include/cmpi or /usr/local/include/cmpi
while the C++ shared library goes to 
/usr/lib or /usr/local/lib 

We recommend the /usr/local prefix for testing purposes only

CMPI 1.0 and existing providers
===============================

If you plan to build CMPI providers written before release 1.0.0 availability
add "#define CMPI_VERSION 90" to the provider source or compile with 
-DCMPI_VERSION=90 option.
